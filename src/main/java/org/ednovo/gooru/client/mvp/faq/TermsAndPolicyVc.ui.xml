								</span>

								<span class="{style.policyTextLine}">
									<u>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.</u>
									The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("
									<b>AAA</b>
									"
									<b>) </b>

									<b>AAA Rules</b>
									") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at

									or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.
								</span>
 -->
						<!-- 		<span class="{style.policyTextLine}">
									<u>Arbitration Process</u>
									. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA
									Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at
									<a class="privacyLinkText" href="http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175">http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175</a>

									.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by
									the parties from the AAA’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7)
									days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
								</span>

								<span class="{style.policyTextLine}">
									<u>Arbitration Location and Procedure.</u>
									Unless you and Ednovo otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed
									$10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Ednovo submit to the arbitrator, unless you request
									a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined
									by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the
									parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
								</span>

								<span class="{style.policyTextLine}">
									<u>Arbitrator’s Decision.</u>
									The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential
									findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having
									jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to
									the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in
									favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in
									arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Ednovo will not
									seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it
									prevails in arbitration.
								</span>

								<span class="{style.policyTextLine}">
									<u>Fees.</u>
									Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your
									claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Ednovo will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim
									or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set
									forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
								</span>

								<span class="{style.policyTextLine}">
									<u>Changes.</u>
									Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Modification" section above, if Ednovo changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you
									first accepted these Terms of Use (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Use), you may reject any such change by sending us
									written notice (including by email to
									<a href="mailto:info@goorulearning.org" class="privacyLinkText">info@goorulearning.org</a>

									authorized representative of Ednovo. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms of Use, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies
									under these Terms of Use will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms of Use or otherwise. If for any reason a court of

									Service Providers</u>
								We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Gooru Service, to provide the Gooru Service on our behalf, to perform
								Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and improvement of the Site’s
								features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Application and Gooru Service are used. These third parties have access to your

							</span>

							<span class="{style.policyTextLine}">
								<u>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</u>
								Ednovo cooperates with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We will disclose any
								information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or
								appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including but not limited to subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Ednovo or a

								<u>Business Transfers.</u>
								Ednovo may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with a merger,

								<b>International Transfer</b>

							<span class="{style.policyTextLine}">
								<u>How Children's Personal Information is Collected.</u>
								We do not collect information about children unless they attempt to register for an Account. When registering for an Account, the child will
								be directly asked for his or her date of birth (to determine age) and a parent or guardian’s email address. We will send an email to the
								parent or guardian’s email address with instructions about how to register for an Account and to create a child’s Account. If the parent or
								guardian does not respond, all information collected from the child is deleted. Once the parent or guardian registers, he or she can set up a
								child Account and create a username, password and, optionally, provide the gender of the child.
							</span>


							<span class="{style.policyTextLine}">
								<u>How Personal Information about Children is Used.</u>
								To the extent any Personal Information is collected about children, it is used for the internal operations of the website and online services,

							</span>


							<span class="{style.policyTextLine}">
								<u>Parental Notification and Consent.</u>
